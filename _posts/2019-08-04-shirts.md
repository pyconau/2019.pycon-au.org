<hr><span class="abstract">Print-to-order PyCon AU shirts can be purchased at [2019.pycon-au.org/shirts](https://2019.pycon-au.org/shirts) until August 18, 2019</span>
<hr>

Due to a wave of registrations after our shirt printing deadline, we had a number of attendees miss out on getting a shirt on site. 

To make sure everyone gets a shirt that fits, we've setup a SpreadShirt store, available at [2019.pycon-au.org/shirts](/shirts), where you can order a shirt delivered to you. 

This store will be open for aproxx. 2 weeks, until August 18 2019.

If you ordered an extra shirt specifically and did not collect it, you have already been refunded. 

If you were supposed to get a shirt (you ordered before July 9 and gave us a size), email us at [contact@2019.pycon-au.org](mailto:contact@2019.pycon-au.org) by August 18 2019 and we will refund you the cost of the shirt. 

Thank you for your understanding. 

🐍💛💚
