## Talk schedule announced

We're also pleased to confirm we have our conference schedule now available, for each of our [Specialist tracks](/schedule/friday) and our [Saturday](/schedule/saturday) and [Sunday](/schedule/sunday) main conference days. 

We have speakers joining us from all over Australia, New Zealand, and beyond for three days of Python learning!

## Calling for volunteers

We appreciate all the help we can get to put on such an amazing event year on year. We have volunteering opportunities for both partial and full time volunteers, ranging from welcoming attendees to the conference, staffing the registration desk, to helping us record the talks.

Full time volunteers get free entry to the conference. Sign up closes June 30
