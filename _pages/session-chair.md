## What's involved in being a session chair?

Being a session chair is a great way to get involved in the conference. It involves:

 * Introducing three delightful speakers in a series of talks in a room
 * Holding up time cards to let the speakers know they have 5, 2, 1 minute remaining
 * Helping facilitate Q&A, if the speaker wants questions after their talk

There will be a full session chair briefing at the beginning of mornign tea on Saturday morning where we'll share full details on how to be a session chair.


## How do I sign up?
