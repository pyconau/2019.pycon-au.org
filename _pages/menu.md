# Menu and Catering

Through the generous support of our sponsors we are able to cater PyCon AU directly from our venue, ICC Sydney. 

We will be serving a variety of meals throughout the event through ICC's venue catering, but only for portions of the event. 

This pages includes both information about when meals will be catered, but also details about the meals themselves, and allergy information, where this has been provided by the ICC. 

At this stage, we are not providing any arrival refreshments. Would you like to help make this happen? [Become a sponsor](https://2019.pycon-au.org/sponsor/)

Menu details can be found for each day: [Friday](/menu/friday), [Saturday](/menu/saturday), [Sunday](/menu/sunday), [Monday](/menu/monday), [Tuesday](/menu/tuesday)
