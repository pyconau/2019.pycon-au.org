        Fun fact - In 2019 every school kid in Australia from Grades 3-8 is learning to
        code. And lots of them are doing it through courses on Grok Learning.
        <br><br>
        Our platform helps teachers teach things like Python, Web and micro:bit. One of
        their favourite things is our auto-marker - we give feedback to students by
        running their code on our servers (a sandboxing nightmare!).
        <br><br>
        We've got interesting problems to solve, like - How do you simulate a
        micro-controller for marking? Can we design an interface that helps you
        understand code? How do you write a course that kids find engaging?
        <br><br>
        Our platform is built on Python (with other stuff) and our office is over in
        Glebe, near Sydney University. If CS education interests you, you should chat
