You can systematically improve at public speaking. 

I am an introverted software engineer. I used to be terrified of public speaking, but I learned to feel confident on stage after more than a decade of performing stand-up, improv, and sketch comedy. 

With a few small tweaks, you can dramatically improve as a public speaker. I'll share the most effective strategies I use for every presentation. Learn how to communicate to any audience, common mistakes to avoid, and how stand-up comedians deal with hecklers.
