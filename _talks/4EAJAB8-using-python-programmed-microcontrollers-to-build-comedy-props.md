      Early-career comedians often have difficulties adding electronic props to their acts, due to the high cost of materials and fabrication skills required. This talk will recreate several props used in comedic performances, showing the code and components used.

Early-career comedians often have difficulties adding theatrical property (or props) to their acts, due to the high cost of materials and fabrication skills required. This barrier to entry is increased when digital electronics are involved.

However, contemporary microcontroller technologies such as the micro:bit and circuit playground allow comedians to acquire prototyping technology at reduced cost, and theÂ power and simplicity of the Python programming language provides beginner developers with a foundation to develop useful props for their act.

This presentation will introduce some of the challenges early-career comedians may face when commencing developing their performance. This presentation will re-create common comedic props such as:
- a spinning bow-tie,
- a theremin, and
- a sound-sensitive light costume.

By the end of this talk audience members will have an appreciation for the challenges early-career comedians may face. Audience members will also get a foundation in developing simple props used in a comedy act and the python programming skills required to build such props.
