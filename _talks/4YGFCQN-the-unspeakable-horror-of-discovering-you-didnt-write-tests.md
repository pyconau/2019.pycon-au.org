speakers:
- biography: Melanie is a creator, tinkerer, and aspiring do-gooder. She does Python-y
    things with Django, and feelings-y things with a cool service she made called
    Five Up. She's mentally ill and doesn't mind talking about it. One time she met
    Scott Bakula.
  name: Melanie Crutchfield

      I didn't write tests. I'm here to help you avoid making the same mistake.

Public service announcement: if you don't write tests, you will instead write code for a time machine to go back and train a band of feisty raccoons to dump grape jelly on the head of your past self because you'll have realized she is a terrible, lazy, no good awful person.

How do I know?

*(revs up time machine)*

Because I didn't write tests.

This talk is for the blissfully ignorant or for those whose hubris threatens to burn them up in the sun. That is, it's for people who are new to Python programming and see testing as a thing they'll get around to eventually, and/or people who have been writing Python for a while but have yet to believe in the magic of testing. 

We'll discuss:

- How I did development without writing tests
- Being plopped into the deep end of testing
- Revisiting untested code; THIS IS AWFUL
- Retrofitting untested Django code
- Other handy testing tricks
