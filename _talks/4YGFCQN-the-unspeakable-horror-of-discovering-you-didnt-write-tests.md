title: The Unspeakable Horror of Discovering You Didn't Write Tests
track: django
nicetrack: "DjangoCon AU"
type: talk

speakers:
- biography: Melanie is a creator, tinkerer, and aspiring do-gooder. She does Python-y
    things with Django, and feelings-y things with a cool service she made called
    Five Up. She's mentally ill and doesn't mind talking about it. One time she met
    Scott Bakula.
  name: Melanie Crutchfield

abstract: | 
      I didn't write tests. I'm here to help you avoid making the same mistake.

Public service announcement: if you don't write tests, you will instead write code for a time machine to go back and train a band of feisty raccoons to dump grape jelly on the head of your past self because you'll have realized she is a terrible, lazy, no good awful person.

How do I know?

*(revs up time machine)*

Because I didn't write tests.

If you are new to Python programming and see testing as a thing you’ll get around to eventually, this talk is for you. Or if you’ve been writing Python for a while but have yet to believe in the magic of testing, this talk is for you. If you hate tests, and Python, and people who talk about tests and Python…maybe go get a donut or something because I don’t think you’ll like this talk. 

We'll discuss:

- How I did development without writing tests
- Being plopped into the deep end of testing
- Revisiting untested code; THIS IS AWFUL
- Retrofitting untested Django code
- Other handy testing tricks

Come play! It’ll be fun and awful and exciting and possibly informative.
