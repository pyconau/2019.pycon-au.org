      A few years ago we found ourselves teaching students everything from Python to Arduino.  It was our plan to replace all the other languages with Python as we streamlined our course.   Learn why we introduced drones, what we learned not to do and what we were surprised about.

A few years ago, we found ourselves expecting students to pick up PHP, SQL, Arduino, JavaScript and Python.   While each had a purpose - PHP for server side interactions, for example - we felt there would be better depth of knowledge if we could replace all with Python.    We also wanted to stay open-sourced, if possible.

We also felt that if we could begin right at the beginning with Python, students would be able to experience a continuity throughout their education, rather than discrete packages of knowledge.  

Drones and python - whatever could go wrong?  Sharp blades, 15 year old boys and a bit of code.
