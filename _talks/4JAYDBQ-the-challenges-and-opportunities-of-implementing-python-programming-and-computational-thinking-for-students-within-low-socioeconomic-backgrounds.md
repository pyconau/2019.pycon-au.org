  biography: "Paulo da Silva is a passionate STEM Educator with a background in ICT,\
    \ Earth Sciences research, and STEM Curriculum Design and student engagement.\
    \ As an emerging leader in scientific literacy, Paulo believes in empowering students\
    \ to develop 21st century skills to become active players in the current technological\
    \ revolution; they must be encouraged to use curiosity and creativity to investigate,\
    \ prototype, design and innovate, in pursuit of the product developments and ideas\
    \ of tomorrow.\n\nAdditionally, Paulo assisted Wyndham Central College to develop\
    \ the first integrated STEM Education program in the western suburbs of Melbourne:\
    \ \u2018STEM Academy\u2019. Recently, he assisted in the development of industry-based\
    \ programs for the new Wyndham and Geelong Tech Schools in Victoria, which will\
    \ benefit thousands of students and teachers in these regions.\n\nPaulo campaigns\
    \ for the improvement of STEM Education opportunities for students from low socioeconomic\
    \ backgrounds."

abstract: | 
      This talk reflects on the challenges faced by educators keen to introduce Python and CS skills for low SES background students at a school in [TOWN], [STATE], and how students reflected on how long lifelong learning is vital to their future in a highly automated-technology driven society.

In Australia, some confusion remains regarding what STEM Education is and how its integration into our classrooms can benefit our students. For example, coding/programming has been a hot topic over the past five years, and many schools have developed very successful programs to assist students gaining valuable computational thinking skills. However, although most teachers recognise the need to teach computational thinking skills to their students, in most schools, teachers still struggle to develop relevant-updated computer science skills for a number of reasons including lack of support and/or vision from school leadership, lack of confidence, time and resources.

In this presentation, the author aims to share his story on how Python programing language and a Project Based-Learning task has assisted students from low-socioeconomic backgrounds in [TOWN], [STATE], gain valuable computational thinking skills. Students learnt how to use their newly acquired skills to start "coding with purpose‚Äù, a vision that was pivotal to motivate students to pursue learning programming languages outside school hours, which consequently has given them the opportunity to understand how long lifelong learning is vital to their future in a highly automated-technology driven society.
