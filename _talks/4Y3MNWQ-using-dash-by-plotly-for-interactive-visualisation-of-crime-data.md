- biography: 'As a Mathematician, Data Miner and Social Scientist I develop software
    for 20+ years. I looked into programming with Python approximately 15 year ago
    - because *block definition by indentation* intrigued me.


    Since then I have used Python for development in various projects from CLI tools
    to web apps to data exploration. Currently I focus on crime data analysis in the
    Australian context.


    I live with my wife and little son in Australia''s calm capital Canberra - under
    mostly beautiful blue sky. :-)'

abstract: | 
      Dash is a great Python framework for building data visualisation websites. In this talk I discuss the framework basics, explore a sample site and describe its use for an enterprise application to graph crime statistics. I finish with clear pros and cons of the Dash framework from our perspective.
