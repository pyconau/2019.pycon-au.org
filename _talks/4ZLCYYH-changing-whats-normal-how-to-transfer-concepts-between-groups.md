      This talk focuses on how to change people’s minds, and successfully introduce new concepts to groups and individuals without damaging relationships.
---

Each of us travels across cultures - work and home, multiple friendship groups. We even travel across micro-cultures - adjacent work teams, different arms of the family. We navigate groups with different communication norms, consent norms, political awareness, technical knowledge, and assumptions of morality, and we do it several times a day. 

How do we do that successfully? More importantly, how do we bring new concepts to existing groups without damaging relationships? 

We do it by accepting that normal is different everywhere, but it doesn’t have to remain the same over time. This talk will cover change management theory and practice, organisational transformation techniques, and complexity communication.

The audience will leave with concrete tools for enabling organisational and group behaviour change, and adaptive communication strategies for translating contexts and concepts across domains.
