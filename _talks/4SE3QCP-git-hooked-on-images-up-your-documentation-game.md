  biography: "Before becoming a programmer, Veronica was a researcher with an eye\
    \ for process improvement (she helped pick the Mars Curiosity Rover\u2019s landing\
    \ site!). She loves exploring the web and teaching, and speaks on building the\
    \ tooling & docs you need and has co-taught a PyCon tutorial on using web-scraping\
    \ and machine learning to predict Oscar winners. When she isn\u2019t thinking\
    \ about how the web can be better for developers, she enjoys blogging and snuggling\
    \ as many cats as possible."

Can you remember the difference between two hex color values? Me neither! Entering visual representations of recently-changed elements into version control makes review of past changes easier & speeds acclimation to a new web project, especially for visual learners.  Surprisingly, methods for including images in your version control arenâ€™t standardized and are rarely used outside of large companies, and the rest of us are left checking out every major commit and viewing changes locally! Join me for a review of methods currently in use and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each. The audience will learn from a survey of tools used by both designers and web developers, what methods are most appropriate for individual projects, & how these methods differ from those used at some of the largest companies (Google, eBay, etc.). Finding a method to track changes in your visual elements will save our future contributors (and future selves!) the pain of having to distinguish #2dc651 (lime green) from #34a34e (darker(!) lime green) and ultimately make our commit histories cleaner and our repos easier to navigate in ways that many of us have never imagined!

**About me & this topic**

Before I was a programmer, I worked with in a science that relies on visual work and spent a lot of time thinking about how to incorporate our images and screenshots into our research. As I entered web development, I found myself asking the same questions and began learning as much as I could about ways that folks do/don't incorporate images into their workflows and what they see as the benefits/costs.
