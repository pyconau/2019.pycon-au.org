What do we do, and why do we do it? In a world where DevOps and the Cloud demand new mentalities and modes of thinking from our technologies, we need to dive deeply into how people act in organisations, and the impact that this has on our ability to work and grow, and how to change things — for the better.

As the defining voice of the ideas of “Contempt Culture”, Aurynn is working to
change the very nature of how we create and work with new technologies, and the
questions that we must answer as we do.
