From the Privacy Act, the Census and Statistics Act, and the Archives Act, to the My Health Record Act, the recently passed Access and Assistance Act and the impending Data Sharing and Release Act, not to mention things like GDPR.

It's all undergoing a fundamental rethink, and while this happens, you still need to ship product. How do you even start to deal with this?

Learn about various oddities, loopholes, gaps, and traps for the unwary in the current array of legislation, and how it's changing.

We'll look at some concrete examples of projects that have hit problems, and how you can avoid those problems.

Learn how to care about data privacy and security without getting overwhelmed, and where to go for help.
