  biography: I am a final year Computer Science student from India. I tinker around
    opensource both communities and projects and have created some on my own. Recently
    my native place Kerala had the worst flood in its history. I helped to create
    the official flood coordination website for the government using Django. This
    website was used to track stranded individuals using their GPS locations, aggregate
    this data, provide API access to 3rd parties who run their own search and rescue.

abstract: | 
      In the month of August 2018, Kerala, the southernmost state of India, received 250 % of normal rainfall, resulting in all of its 44 dams to be opened. Over 483 people died. I started a website (keralarescue.in), written in Django for the effective collaboration and communication between authorities,

keralarescue.in was a website born to help aid the rescue and volunteering efforts during the floods. What started as a portal for people to request for food, water and other resources became a rescue portal that used GPS location to send helicopters to the location of the stranded individuals.

The site was open source from Day 0. About 1500 developers
and volunteers onboard our slack group in a couple of days.
Within a week, the community united to forge a critical
piece of software that saved thousands of lives. 

The Minimum Viable Product was delivered in fourteen
hours. In the initial days, it was only used by the volunteers
and Point of Contacts assigned by the government. Later,
when the situation became critical, we started getting
rescue requests from stranded refugees. The Github repo of
the website went viral, and we started to receive feature
requests rapidly. We received more than ve hundred pull
requests in the span of three weeks.

The story I want to present is about the community and
technical aspects of https://keralarescue.in/, how people from
different backgrounds came together to build a critical
piece of software that saved many lives
