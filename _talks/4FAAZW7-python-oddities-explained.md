A number of Python features often seem counterintuitive at first glance, especially when moving from another programming language to Python. Often what at first seems like a bug, will later reveal itself to be a misunderstood feature.

During this talk we’ll look at a number of Python’s unique features and quirks and attempt to re-shape our mental models of Python to better match reality. By the end of this talk you’ll have a deeper understanding of Python’s rules behind objects, scope, and variables.

Warning: this talk will include many Python head scratchers so show up prepared to think on your feet!
