abstract: | 
      Jupyter notebooks are revolutionary tools used across many domains and support the use of over 50 kernels!? Are these suitable for all audiences and applications? This talk will dive into some of the best and lesser known features of notebooks and best practices to include them in your workflow.

Jupyter notebooks have become a hugely popular tool in research, machine learning, data science, education, and many many areas.  Their use and adoption have opened the door to a new paradigm: the emergence of literate programming. And with this new paradigm, the users are not only able to develop quick prototypes but also generate compelling narratives in which the code and its outputs are presented side by side. Hence why big companies such as Google and Microsoft have created their own ports of the notebooks: Google collab and Azure notebooks.

This talk will examine with critical eyes the uses, advantages and disadvantages of the Jupyter notebooks. It will, for this purpose, take the audience into a journey across some of the best tools and lesser-known features of the notebooks (examples included).  Later on, we will explore some of the pain points that come with notebooks and cases for which Jupyter notebooks are not the best tool to do the job as well as alternatives for such cases. Finally, I will present a set of best practices and workflows for Jupyter notebooks.
